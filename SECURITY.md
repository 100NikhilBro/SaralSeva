# Security Policy

## ðŸ”’ Automated Security Management

SaralSeva takes security seriously and uses automated tools to maintain a secure codebase.

### Dependabot Security Updates

This repository uses GitHub Dependabot for automated security vulnerability management:

- **Immediate Response**: Security vulnerabilities are automatically detected and PRs created
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All modules (backend, user, admin, employee portals) are monitored
- **Priority Handling**: Security updates are prioritized over feature updates
- **Smart Grouping**: Security fixes are grouped separately for faster review and deployment

### Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for:

| Module          | Version | Supported |
| --------------- | ------- | --------- |
| Backend API     | 1.0.x   | âœ…        |
| User Portal     | 0.0.x   | âœ…        |
| Admin Portal    | 0.0.x   | âœ…        |
| Employee Portal | 0.0.x   | âœ…        |

### Reporting a Vulnerability

2. **Primary Contact**: [@eccentriccoder01](https://github.com/eccentriccoder01)
3. **Issues**: For non-sensitive security discussions, create an issue with the `security` label

**Please include:**

- Detailed reproduction steps
- Potential impact assessment
- Affected components/versions
- Suggested remediation (if known)

### Response Timeline & Responsible Disclosure

- **Manual Reports**:
  - Acknowledgment: Within 72 hours
  - Initial Assessment: Within 1 week
  - Fix Timeline: Varies by severity
    - Critical: Within 24-48 hours
    - High: Within 1 week
    - Medium: Within 1 month
